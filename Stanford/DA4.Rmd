ISLR Ch 4 Lab
4.6.1 The Stock Market Data
```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(ggplot2)
?Smarket
names(Smarket)
```
```{r}
model1 = Smarket
dim(Smarket)
```

this data set has 1250 rows and 9 columns 
```{r}
summary(Smarket)
```
```{r}
cor(Smarket[,-9]) 
```
we make -9 because the direction column consists text. 
The correlations between today's returns and previous days' returns (lag1-5) are really close to zero, so there's no relationship between previous returns and today's. 
The only significant correlation is between volume and year (0.539), so let's plot it 

```{r}
plot(Smarket$Year, Smarket$Volume)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = model1) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Volume, y = Year, color = Direction))
```
through this graphs we can see that volume is increasing as time passes by
