```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
states = row.names(USArrests)
states
```
we got the names of rows - states of the US 

```{r}
names(USArrests)
```

here are the names of colums 

```{r}
apply(USArrests, 2, mean)
```

apply works the same as in python
2 means that we want this function to be applied for columns 

```{r}
apply(USArrests, 2, var)
```
